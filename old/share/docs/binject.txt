    class Binject
     |  a mechanism for transmitting data in specific bits of binary
     |  
     |  injected bits appear in little-endian order (lowest order bit first)
     |  
     |  specifying alignment means that an octet's bits cannot be split along
     |  multiple binaries
     |  
     |  trail specifies whether to generate bits whose numbers don't
     |  make up an entire octet
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, positions=(), align=False, trail=False)
     |  
     |  extract(self, generator)
     |      generate extracted octets from the generated binaries
     |  
     |  inject(self, generator, src='')
     |      inject the octets across the generated binaries
     |      
     |      note that the output binaries will be of the same type as
     |      the input ones; their type's constructor must be able to
     |      handle a single bytearray argument
