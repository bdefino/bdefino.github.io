<p>Good encryption is tough to come by, and the theoretical usefulness of the One
Time Pad isn&#39;t all that easy in practice.  <code>xor</code> attempts to alleviate that.</p>

<p>Well, what makes this tool different from the tons of others out there?  Easy:
<url>
<li>it&#39;s simple&#8211;the CLI is already minimal,</li>
<li>it&#39;s secure&#8211;the <em>single source file</em> is open, contains a breakdown on the
    precautions taken, plus it&#39;s easy to read&#47;verify,</li>
<li>and it <strong>supports multiple input files</strong>&#8211;this means you can <em>securely</em>
    encipher a plaintext with <strong>multiple keys</strong>.</li></ul></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the name of security, this is extremely slow: in fact, it only encrypts a
single character at a time!  That way, if an attacker is able to recover
pages from its address space, loss of cryptographic secrets is minimized.
This approach is hugely advantageous over trust-based alternatives, such as a
dedicated cryptographic coprocessor, or using a dedicated machine for
cryptographic purposes for the reason that <strong><code>xor</code> expects to be attacked</strong>.</p>

<p>Oh, and here&#39;s the full help text:
<pre>
securely XOR files to STDOUT
Usage: .&#47;bin&#47;xor FILE...
FILE
    path to an input FILE;
    `-` means STDIN
OPTIONS
    -h
        display this text and exit
    -l
        output as many bytes as the longest
        input; for FIFO-like FILEs, output is
        infinite)
